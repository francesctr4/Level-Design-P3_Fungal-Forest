# Level Design P3: _Fungal Forest_

This project presents a **custom level for the classic _Spyro the Dragon_** series, designed as if it were part of an official game expansion. Inspired by the original trilogy, the goal is to analyze and reinterpret Spyro’s level design principles while introducing a fresh, yet faithful, gameplay experience.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To design a new level that:
- Stays true to Spyro's core mechanics and structure.
- Introduces new environmental themes and gameplay elements.
- Demonstrates a deep understanding of the original level design through analysis and creative reinterpretation.

## 🌱 Concept Overview

**Level Theme:** _Bioluminescent Hollow_  
A mysterious, underground mushroom forest filled with glowing fungi and crystalline caves. This bioluminescent biome, largely unexplored in the original games, serves as a rich and atmospheric setting.

**Visual Style:**
- Dark greens and purples contrast with glowing elements.
- A vibrant, alien-like ecosystem within Spyro’s colorful and friendly visual language.

---

## 🔥 Core Mechanics

- **Crystal Activation:** Spyro uses his fire breath to activate glowing crystals. These crystals reveal hidden platforms, open doors, or power temporary mechanisms, introducing time-based exploration and puzzle elements.
- **Vertical Exploration:** Giant mushroom caps act as natural trampolines, encouraging players to explore vertical spaces and uncover secrets.
- **Strategic Combat:** Enemies require different strategies depending on their composition (crystalline vs. organic), promoting variety and thoughtful use of Spyro’s abilities.

## 🗺️ Level Structure

The level is divided into **three distinct areas**:

### 1. Crystal Cavern
A tutorial-like introduction zone that teaches the core mechanic of crystal activation. The distant silhouette of the final goal — the Silver Tower — is visible from here, acting as a landmark.

### 2. Fungal Forest
A sprawling, vertical zone filled with hidden paths and optional routes. The Silver Tower is protected by a force field powered by three crystal energy devices scattered throughout the forest. Players must explore and deactivate each device to proceed.

### 3. Silver Tower (Final Challenge)
A vertical gauntlet where Spyro battles waves of enemies, including a new type — _crystal scorpions_ — that require a combination of attacks to defeat. This climax tests everything the player has learned.

## 👾 Enemies

Includes a mix of new creatures and familiar foes with redesigned behaviors. Each enemy requires specific tactics to defeat, encouraging varied and strategic combat.
